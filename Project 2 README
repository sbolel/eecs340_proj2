--- TCP features ---

Three-way handshake is implemented and passive and active opens are supported. Received packets in established state are relayed to the server from the client.

Go-back-N doesnt work.

Testing: Testing with netcat and tcp_client can establish connections, relay messages, but close connections has problems after going into closing state.
